---

## 🏠 Unauthenticated Landing Page

### Current State
- Header with "MC-ORG" logo/title
- Navigation: Home and Idea Bank links
- Theme toggle button (icon only)
- Main content:
  - Hero heading: "Organize Your Minecraft Projects"
  - Subtitle: "Plan, track and collaborate on your Minecraft builds, farms and redstone contraptions"
  - "Sign in with Microsoft" button with Microsoft logo
  - Help text: "Sign in with your Microsoft account to start organizing your Minecraft projects."
- Three feature cards:
  1. **Organize Projects** - "Keep track of all your Minecraft projects, from simple builds to complex redstone contraptions."
  2. **Collaborate** - "Invite friends to collaborate on your worlds and projects, assigning tasks and tracking progress together."
  3. **Resource Management** - "Track resource locations, manage farms, and plan your resource gathering efficiently."

### UX Improvements Identified

#### High Priority
1. **Font Loading Errors**: Console shows 13 font loading failures (Roboto_Mono and Segoe UI) - impacts page load performance
2. **No Preview/Screenshots**: No visual representation of what the app looks like - users can't see what they're signing up for
3. **Single Sign-In Method**: Only Microsoft authentication shown - no indication of other methods or why Microsoft is required
4. **Idea Bank Accessible When Unauthenticated**: Navigation shows "Idea Bank" link - unclear if accessible without auth
5. **No Demo/Trial Option**: No way to explore app features without signing in

#### Medium Priority
6. **Feature Card Icons**: Icons present but need verification they're clear and meaningful
7. **No Call-to-Action Hierarchy**: Only one CTA (sign in) - could add secondary action like "Learn More" or "See Demo"
8. **Missing Trust Indicators**: No user testimonials, user count, or social proof
9. **No Feature Comparison**: Doesn't explain what makes this different from other project management tools
10. **Help Text Redundancy**: "Sign in with your Microsoft account..." repeats what the button already says
11. **No Privacy/Terms Links**: No links to privacy policy, terms of service, or data handling information

#### Low Priority
12. **Hero Section Content Density**: Large hero section could include more visual interest (background, illustration)
13. **Feature Cards Layout**: Three cards in a row may not be optimal on all screen sizes
14. **No "Why Microsoft?" Explanation**: Doesn't explain why Microsoft authentication is used (Minecraft account?)
15. **No FAQ Section**: Common questions about features, pricing, etc. not addressed
16. **No Footer**: Missing footer with additional links, contact info, or copyright
17. **Navigation Incomplete**: Home and Idea Bank shown but no "About" or "Features" pages
18. **Theme Toggle on Landing**: Theme toggle present but users can't customize before signing in (minor)

---

## 📄 Landing Page / World List Page (Authenticated)

### Current State
- Page displays world cards with search functionality
- Header navigation with Home, Idea Bank, Admin links
- Icons for theme toggle, notifications, and profile
- "Create World" button with icon
- World cards show: title, MC version, description, progress (0 of 5 projects), creation date, progress bar, "View World" button

### UX Improvements Identified

#### High Priority
1. **Empty State Missing**: No guidance when user has no worlds (need to verify if empty state exists) ✅
2. **Search Feedback**: Search textbox lacks clear visual feedback (no search icon, no clear button)
3. **Progress Bar Accessibility**: 0% progress bar may not have proper ARIA labels for screen readers
4. **Button Hierarchy**: "View World" and "Create World" have same visual weight - consider primary/secondary styling
5. **Icon-Only Buttons**: Theme toggle, notifications, and profile buttons lack text labels or tooltips (accessibility concern) ✅

#### Medium Priority
6. **Date Format**: "Created at: 31/07/2025" - inconsistent format (consider relative time: "2 days ago") ✅
7. **World Card Information Density**: Cards could show more useful info (last updated, owner/members, recent activity)
8. **Skeleton Loading**: No indication of loading states when fetching worlds ✅
9. **Mobile Navigation**: Need to verify if navigation collapses appropriately on mobile
10. **World Card Actions**: Only "View World" action - consider quick actions (edit, archive, share)

#### Low Priority
11. **MC Version Icon**: Small icon may not be clear on all screens
12. **Progress Visualization**: Progress bar and text are redundant - could be combined more elegantly ✅
13. **Search Scope**: Not clear what fields are being searched (title only? description too?)
14. **Keyboard Navigation**: Need to verify tab order and keyboard shortcuts
15. **Sorting/Filtering**: No visible way to sort or filter worlds beyond search ✅

---

## 🌍 World Page (Project List)

### Current State
- World header with title, MC version, and description
- "New Project" and "Settings" buttons
- Project cards showing: title, completion %, category (Testing/Idea), description (empty), task count, updated date, overall progress bar, current stage progress bar, "View project" button
- Multiple projects displayed (5 projects visible)

### UX Improvements Identified

#### High Priority
1. **Duplicate Progress Indicators**: Each project shows TWO progress bars (overall + current stage) which is confusing and redundant ✅
2. **Empty Descriptions**: Projects with no description show empty space - could collapse or show placeholder ✅
3. **No Breadcrumbs**: No way to navigate back to world list without using browser back button ✅
4. **Stage Information Missing**: "Current stage progress" label without showing which stage the project is in ✅
5. **Completion Percentage Redundancy**: "0% Complete" text duplicates the progress bar information ✅
6. **Icon Accessibility**: Category icons (Testing, Idea) lack alt text or tooltips ✅

#### Medium Priority
7. **Date Format Inconsistency**: "Updated 14/10/2025" uses different format than world list page ✅
8. **No Project Filtering/Sorting**: With 5 projects visible, need way to filter by category or sort by progress/date
9. **Button Visual Hierarchy**: "New Project" and "Settings" have equal weight - "New Project" should be primary action
10. **No Quick Actions**: Can only "View project" - no way to quickly edit, archive, or see project details
11. **World Description Truncation**: Long descriptions may not be handled well (need to verify)
12. **MC Version Static**: Version info could link to version notes or be more interactive

#### Low Priority
13. **Empty Project State**: When world has no projects, unclear what empty state looks like ✅
14. **Project Card Height**: Cards with empty descriptions create inconsistent heights
15. **Updated Date Precision**: No relative time ("2 days ago" vs absolute dates) ✅
16. **Navigation Highlight**: Current page (Home/Idea Bank/Admin) not visually indicated in nav

---

## ⚙️ World Settings Page

### Current State
- Back button "Back to My world 3" with icon
- "World Settings" heading with subtitle "Manage your world settings and members"
- Three tabs: General (selected), Members, Statistics
- **General Tab**: 
  - World Name textbox with "Update Name" button
  - World Description textbox with "Update Description" button
  - Game Version dropdown with "Update Version" button
  - Danger Zone section with "Delete World" button and warning text
- Good: Back button provides navigation, Danger Zone is visually separated

### UX Improvements Identified

#### High Priority
1. **Individual Update Buttons**: Each field has separate "Update" button - should auto-save or have single "Save Changes" button at bottom ✅
2. **No Unsaved Changes Warning**: Users may navigate away without saving changes ✅
3. **Delete Confirmation Missing**: "Delete World" button needs confirmation modal with type-to-confirm pattern
4. **No Form Validation Feedback**: No indication of required fields, character limits, or validation rules
5. **Breadcrumbs Missing**: "Back to My world 3" is good but doesn't show full navigation path (Home > Worlds > My world 3 > Settings) ✅

#### Medium Priority
6. **Tab Content Not Visible**: Need to check Members and Statistics tabs for their UX issues
7. **Success Feedback Location**: Unclear where success messages appear after updating fields ✅
8. **Game Version Dropdown**: No indication of available versions or which versions are compatible
9. **Field Labels Not Associated**: Labels appear as text above fields but may not be programmatically associated (accessibility) ✅
10. **No Cancel/Reset Option**: No way to revert changes before updating
11. **Settings Not Grouped**: Could group related settings into collapsible sections for better organization

#### Low Priority
12. **Danger Zone Visual**: Could use more prominent visual treatment (red border, different background) ✅
13. **Subtitle Redundancy**: "Manage your world settings and members" is generic and doesn't add value
14. **No Keyboard Shortcuts**: Could add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Ctrl+S to save)
15. **Help Text Missing**: No inline help or tooltips explaining what each setting does

### Members Tab Analysis

#### High Priority
1. **Invitation Form Layout**: Form fields are stacked awkwardly - could use horizontal layout for better space usage
2. **No Email/Username Validation**: No indication if username is valid before sending invitation
3. **Invitation Status Tabs Clutter**: 6 tabs (Pending, Accepted, Declined, Expired, Cancelled, All) with mostly 0 items - could simplify to "Active" and "History"
4. **Empty State in Tabs**: "No invitations found with this status" lacks actionable guidance
5. **Remove Member Confirmation**: "Remove member" button needs confirmation dialog
6. **Owner Cannot Be Changed**: No indication that owner role is permanent or how to transfer ownership

#### Medium Priority
7. **Member List Styling**: Members list could use card styling for better visual separation
8. **Join Date Format**: "Joined on: 2025/10/12" uses yet another date format (third format in the app) ✅
9. **Role Change Feedback**: No indication whether role change requires confirmation or is immediate
10. **Placeholder Text**: "Alex" as placeholder in username field is confusing - should be "Enter username"
11. **No Bulk Actions**: Cannot select multiple members to remove or change roles at once
12. **Member Count Not Shown**: No indication of how many total members exist (important for limits)

#### Low Priority
13. **Avatar Display**: Member avatars shown but unclear if they're customizable or default
14. **No Search/Filter**: With many members, no way to search or filter the member list
15. **Invitation History Value**: 31 cancelled invitations cluttering the UI - consider archiving old invitations

### Statistics Tab Analysis

#### High Priority
1. **Not Implemented**: Tab shows "Statistics tab is not implemented yet." - should either be hidden or show coming soon message
2. **Tab Still Clickable**: Non-functional tab shouldn't be in navigation - confuses users about application completeness

---

## 📋 Project Page

### Current State
- Back button "Back to world"
- Project header with: title, category badge (Testing), type (Farming Project), coordinates (0, 0, 0)
- Stage dropdown (currently on "Testing")
- "New Task" button
- Six tabs: Tasks (selected), Resources, Location, Stages, Dependencies, Settings
- **Tasks Tab**:
  - Left side: Project Progress section with two progress bars, Task list with search/filter controls
  - Right sidebar: Project Details (Type, Created date, Last Updated date)
  - Empty state: "No tasks found matching the search criteria"
  - Four filter dropdowns: Task Status, Priority, Stage, and search box

### UX Improvements Identified

#### High Priority
1. **Duplicate Progress Bars Again**: Same issue as world page - two progress bars with unclear distinction ✅
2. **Empty State Not Helpful**: "No tasks found matching the search criteria" when there are no tasks at all (0 of 5 tasks) ✅
3. **Coordinates Display**: "0, 0, 0" lacks context (no labels for X, Y, Z)
4. **Too Many Filters for Empty List**: Four filter controls shown when there are no tasks to filter
5. **Stage Dropdown Purpose Unclear**: Not clear if changing stage dropdown moves the project or filters tasks
6. **Sidebar Inefficient Use of Space**: Right sidebar with minimal info takes up significant space

#### Medium Priority
7. **Breadcrumbs Incomplete**: "Back to world" doesn't show full path (Home > World > Project) ✅
8. **Project Type Static**: "Farming Project" shown but not clear if it's editable or what it means
9. **Filter Layout**: Four filters in a row may wrap awkwardly on mobile
10. **Search vs Filter Button**: Has separate "Search" button but also "Clear filters" - inconsistent pattern
11. **Date Format Again**: "12/10/2025" uses yet another format ✅
12. **Category Badge vs Type**: Shows both "Testing" (stage) and "Farming" (type) - relationship unclear
13. **No Task Templates**: Creating tasks from scratch may be tedious - could offer templates

#### Low Priority
14. **Progress Section Redundancy**: Progress shown in header and sidebar and main content
15. **Active Tasks Pre-selected**: "Active Tasks" is default filter which may hide completed tasks by design
16. **Tab Count**: Six tabs may be overwhelming - consider combining some (e.g., Location with Settings)
17. **Project Details Sidebar**: Could be collapsible to save space

---

### Resources Tab Analysis

#### High Priority
1. **Empty State No Guidance**: Empty list with no example of what resources look like when added ✅
2. **Item Name Textbox**: Placeholder is very long and wraps awkwardly - "Item name (e.g., Oak Logs, Stone, Diamond)"
3. **Quantity Field**: Spinbutton lacks label or context for what quantity means

#### Medium Priority
4. **No Resource Categories**: Minecraft has many items - could benefit from autocomplete or categories
5. **Button Icon Redundancy**: "Add resource production" button has icon but text is self-explanatory
6. **No Validation Preview**: Can't see what will be added before clicking button

### Location Tab Analysis

#### High Priority
1. **Coordinate Display Improved**: Shows labeled X, Y, Z coordinates clearly (better than header)
2. **Edit Location Button**: Separate button suggests modal/form, but unclear what editing experience will be
3. **Dimension Badge**: "Overworld" shown as badge but unclear if other dimensions available

#### Medium Priority
4. **No Visual Map**: Coordinates alone don't help users visualize location in world
5. **No Coordinate Validation**: No indication of valid coordinate ranges for Minecraft
6. **Dimension Not Editable**: No indication if dimension can be changed

### Stages Tab Analysis

#### High Priority
1. **Stage Timeline Clarity**: Shows all 7 stages with status indicators (Upcoming vs Entered with date)
2. **No Task Count**: Each stage says "No tasks for this stage" but doesn't show task count when tasks exist
3. **Stage Icons Not Distinct**: Icons may not be clearly associated with stage names
4. **Entered Date Format**: "14/10/2025 at 08:05" is another date format variation ✅

#### Medium Priority
5. **Timeline Visualization**: Linear list doesn't show progression well - could use progress line
6. **Stage Duration**: No indication of how long project was in each stage
7. **Empty Task Message**: "No tasks for this stage" for completed stages might indicate poor planning

### Dependencies Tab Analysis

#### High Priority
1. **Contradictory Messages**: Says "No other projects available" but then shows project "a" as dependency
2. **Remove Dependency Icon**: Small X icon may be hard to click and lacks confirmation
3. **Dependency Status Vague**: "Some dependencies not completed" is not specific enough
4. **Circular Dependency Warning**: No visible warning about circular dependencies

#### Medium Priority
5. **Two-Column Layout**: Dependencies vs Dependents could be side-by-side for comparison
6. **Project Stage Not Shown**: Listed dependency "a" shows stage but no completion percentage
7. **Empty Dependent State**: Good explanatory text for when no projects depend on this one
8. **No Dependency Graph**: With multiple dependencies, a visual graph would help

### Settings Tab Analysis

#### High Priority
1. **Better Form Structure**: All fields in one form with single "Save Changes" button (good pattern!) ✅
2. **No Cancel Button**: Can't revert changes before saving
3. **Delete Confirmation Missing**: "Delete Project" needs confirmation modal ✅
4. **Description Empty**: Empty description field shows no placeholder or help text

#### Medium Priority
5. **Type Dropdown**: Project type shown as dropdown but relationship to project unclear
6. **Danger Zone Styling**: Could be more visually distinct from regular settings
7. **No Character Limits**: No indication of name/description length limits

---

## 💡 Idea Bank Page

### Current State
- Header: "Idea Bank" with subtitle "Browse and share Minecraft contraption ideas with the community"
- "Submit new idea" button with icon
- Left sidebar with extensive filters:
  - Search Ideas textbox
  - Category radio buttons (All Categories, Build, Farm, Storage, Cart Tech, Tnt, Slimestone, Other)
  - Difficulty checkboxes (Start/Mid/End Game, Technical Understanding Recommended/Required)
  - Minimum Rating spinbutton
  - Minecraft Version textbox
  - "Clear All" button
- Right side: List of idea cards showing title, author, date, category badge, description, favorites/ratings, difficulty, version

### UX Improvements Identified

#### High Priority
1. **Filter Sidebar Width**: Extensive filters take up significant horizontal space, limiting idea card display
2. **Category as Radio**: Radio buttons for categories prevent multi-category selection
3. **Difficulty Checkboxes Verbose**: Long labels like "Technical Understanding Recommended" create layout issues
4. **Search Doesn't Auto-Apply**: Search textbox likely requires submit button or Enter key (not instant)
5. **Minimum Rating Spinbutton**: Unclear what values are valid (0-5? 1-10?) and purpose isn't obvious
6. **Version Format Unclear**: Textbox placeholder "e.g., 1.20.1" but unclear if partial matches work

#### Medium Priority
7. **Filter Collapse**: Filters should be collapsible on mobile/smaller screens
8. **Card Truncation**: Description "HelloHelloHello..." shows poor text wrapping/truncation
9. **Rating Display**: "0,0 ⭐ (0 ratings)" uses comma as decimal (locale issue?) and is redundant
10. **No Sort Options**: Can't sort by date, rating, popularity, or alphabetically
11. **Empty Favorites**: "0 favourites" shows even when zero - could hide when empty
12. **Date Format Inconsistency**: "19/10/2025" uses yet another date format (fourth variation) ✅

#### Low Priority
13. **Clear All Location**: "Clear All" at top of filters - could be at bottom too for convenience
14. **No Results Count**: Doesn't show "Showing X of Y ideas"
15. **Category Capitalization**: "Tnt" should be "TNT", "Cart Tech" could be "Minecart Tech"
16. **Filter Application**: Unclear if filters apply on change or need a "Search" button

## 💡 Single Idea Detail Page

### Current State
- Back button "Back to ideas"
- Idea header: title, author, date, star rating
- Category badge (Build) with edit/delete icon button
- Difficulty and version badges (Mid Game, From 1.20.0)
- Description text
- Action buttons: "Favorite (0)" and "Import Idea"
- Rating Distribution section: large average score (0.0), total ratings count, 5 progress bars for star distribution (5 stars to 1 star)
- Comments and ratings section: textbox for comments, optional 5-star rating radio buttons, "Comment" button
- Empty comments list

### UX Improvements Identified

#### High Priority
1. **Star Rating Radio Buttons**: Using radio buttons for stars is non-standard - should use interactive star icons
2. **Rating Label**: "Optional rating:" is lowercase and doesn't match common patterns
3. **Edit/Delete Icon Accessibility**: Small icon button next to category lacks clear indication it's for editing
4. **No Comment Count**: Can't tell if there are comments without scrolling
5. **Empty Rating Distribution**: Showing all 0% bars when there are no ratings clutters the page
6. **Import Idea Button**: Purpose unclear - what does "Import Idea" do? Needs tooltip or better label

#### Medium Priority
7. **Date Format Consistency**: "19/10/2025" continues the date format inconsistency ✅
8. **Star Display in Header**: "0.0 stars" text format doesn't match common rating patterns (usually shows ⭐ icons)
9. **Favorite Count**: "(0)" shown when no favorites - could hide count when zero
10. **Description Repetition**: Same long repeated text from list view - may need better truncation on list
11. **No Breadcrumbs**: Only "Back to ideas" - doesn't show navigation context ✅
12. **Rating Distribution Size**: Takes up significant space even when empty - could be collapsed

#### Low Priority
13. **Comment Textbox Size**: Single-line textbox for comments - should be textarea for longer feedback
14. **No Character Limit**: Comment field lacks character count or limit indicator
15. **Author Link**: Author name "lilpebblez" not clickable - could link to profile
16. **Version Range**: "From 1.20.0" suggests compatibility range but doesn't show "to" version

---

## 👤 Profile Page

### Current State
- Header: "Your Profile" with subtitle "Manage your account settings and preferences"
- **Profile Information** section:
  - "Update your profile information and how others see you" subtitle
  - Display Name textbox (value: "evegul")
  - Minecraft Username textbox (disabled, value: "evegul")
  - "Save Changes" button
- **Account Settings** section:
  - "Manage your account settings and preferences" subtitle
  - **Sign Out** subsection with description and "Sign Out" button
  - **Danger Zone** subsection with description and "Delete Account" button with icon

### UX Improvements Identified

#### High Priority
1. **Subtitle Duplication**: Page subtitle "Manage your account settings and preferences" is identical to Account Settings section subtitle
2. **Disabled Minecraft Username**: Minecraft Username is disabled but no explanation why it can't be changed
3. **Single Save Button**: Only one "Save Changes" button for Display Name - unclear if this is optimal (compare to World Settings individual buttons)
4. **Delete Account No Confirmation**: "Delete Account" button needs strong confirmation modal with type-to-confirm pattern
5. **No Unsaved Changes Warning**: If user edits Display Name and navigates away, no warning about losing changes
6. **Sign Out as Link Button**: Sign Out is styled as both link and button (link wrapping button) - semantic confusion

#### Medium Priority
7. **No Profile Avatar/Image**: No way to upload or display profile picture despite "how others see you" messaging
8. **Limited Profile Fields**: Only Display Name editable - no email, bio, preferences, or other common profile fields
9. **No Success Feedback Location**: Unclear where success message appears after saving changes
10. **Account Settings Vague**: Section header doesn't clearly indicate it's for sign out and deletion only
11. **No Password Change**: No option to change password or manage authentication methods
12. **No Notification Preferences**: Despite notifications icon in header, no way to configure notification settings
13. **Danger Zone Styling**: Could use more prominent visual treatment (red border, different background like World Settings)

#### Low Priority
14. **No Breadcrumbs**: No way to navigate back to previous page without browser back button
15. **No Account Statistics**: Could show useful stats (member since date, worlds created, projects contributed to)
16. **No Privacy Settings**: No way to configure profile visibility or privacy preferences
17. **Sign Out Description Wordy**: "Sign out of your account on this device. You will need to sign in again..." is unnecessarily verbose
18. **Delete Account Icon**: Has icon but Save Changes doesn't - inconsistent button styling
19. **No Theme Preference Saved**: Theme toggle exists in header but no persistence setting visible
20. **Section Spacing**: No visual separation between Profile Information and Account Settings sections

---

## 📊 Cross-Page UX Patterns & Inconsistencies

### Date Format Inconsistencies (Critical) ✅
The application uses **four different date formats** across pages:
- Landing/World List: `31/07/2025` (DD/MM/YYYY)
- World Page: `14/10/2025` (DD/MM/YYYY)
- Settings: `14/10/2025 at 08:05` (DD/MM/YYYY at HH:MM)
- Idea Bank: `19/10/2025` (DD/MM/YYYY)
- Join Date: `2025/10/12` (YYYY/MM/DD)

**Recommendation**: Standardize on one format, preferably with relative time for recent dates ("2 days ago") and absolute dates for older content.
**Solved by**: https://github.com/evengul/mc-org/issues/117 

### Progress Bar Duplication (Critical) ✅
Multiple pages show redundant progress indicators:
- **World Page**: Each project shows overall progress + current stage progress
- **Project Page**: Progress in header, sidebar, and main content area
- **Project Tasks**: Multiple progress bars without clear distinction

**Recommendation**: Single progress indicator per context, with clear labels for what's being measured.
**Solved by**: https://github.com/evengul/mc-org/issues/118

### Button Patterns (High Priority) ✅
Inconsistent update button patterns:
- **World Settings**: Individual "Update Name", "Update Description", "Update Version" buttons
- **Profile Settings**: Single "Save Changes" button for all fields
- **Project Settings**: Single "Save Changes" button for all fields

**Recommendation**: Standardize on either auto-save (preferred) or single "Save Changes" button per form.
**Solved by**: https://github.com/evengul/mc-org/issues/119

### Empty States (High Priority)
Inconsistent empty state quality:
- **Good**: Dependencies tab explains "No other projects available" with helpful context
- **Bad**: Tasks page says "No tasks found matching search criteria" when there are simply no tasks
- **Missing**: Resources tab has no guidance on what resources look like when added

**Recommendation**: All empty states should have: clear message, explanation, and call-to-action.
**Solved by**: https://github.com/evengul/mc-org/issues/120

### Icon-Only Buttons (High Priority - Accessibility) ✅
Multiple pages have icon-only buttons without labels:
- Header: Theme toggle, notifications, profile (no text labels or tooltips)
- Idea Detail: Edit/delete icon next to category
- Project: Remove dependency (small X icon)

**Recommendation**: Add aria-labels and tooltips for all icon-only buttons, or include visible text labels.
**Solved by**: https://github.com/evengul/mc-org/issues/121

### Danger Zone Styling (Medium Priority) ✅
Inconsistent danger zone treatment:
- **World Settings**: Separate "Danger Zone" section with warning text
- **Profile Settings**: "Danger Zone" as paragraph header without special styling
- **Project Settings**: Delete button without distinct danger zone

**Recommendation**: Standardize danger zone styling with red border, warning icon, and clear separation.
**Solved by**: https://github.com/evengul/mc-org/issues/122

### Navigation Patterns (Medium Priority)
Inconsistent back navigation:
- Some pages: "Back to [specific name]" with icon
- Other pages: No breadcrumbs or back button
- Header navigation doesn't highlight current page

**Recommendation**: Implement consistent breadcrumb navigation showing full path.
**Solved by**: https://github.com/evengul/mc-org/issues/123

### Filter/Search Patterns (Medium Priority)
Inconsistent filter application:
- Landing page: Search textbox (unclear if instant or submit-based)
- Idea Bank: Extensive filters with "Clear All" button
- Project Tasks: Four filters with "Search" button AND "Clear filters" button

**Recommendation**: Standardize on instant filtering with clear visual feedback and consistent clear mechanism.
**Solved by**: https://github.com/evengul/mc-org/issues/124
