## Start and stop an actual server

### Usecases
 - I want to be able to start a server using the current configuration
 - I want to be able to stop the running server
 - I want to be able to restart the running server
 - I want to be able to change configuration (version, modpack(s) etc) easily
 - I want the server to be persistent across restarts

## Resource Directory (mods, datapacks etc)
 - I want to be able to register a resources identified by the minecraft version they are usable in, along with a link to download it
 - I want to have these resources auto-update if possible (check github for new downloads? API?)

## Projects
 - I want to upload litematica-files and convert these into projects. As an MVP, I can upload the material list you can generate through the app
 - A project can have doable and countable tasks
 - A project should have a title, a set of doable and a set of countable tasks
 - I want to create dependencies between projects, so I know what has to be done first
 - I want to view what I have left on a project, especially the countable ones.
